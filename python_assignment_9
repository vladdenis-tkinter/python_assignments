3) os.getcwd() returns current working directory, os.chdir(path) changes current directory to given in parameter 'path'
4) The '..' folder is a folder that is 1 step up current directory (example: for 'C://test/folder' os.chdir('..') returns 'C://test' directory)
   The '.' allows to walk is subdirectories of current directory (example: for 'C://test'   os.chdir('.folder')  gets us in directory 'C://test/folder')
